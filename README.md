# Asset Bundle Browser Ciphered tool for Unity

This tool mixes Unity's official [Asset Bundle Browser](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AssetBundles-Browser) and [TakuKobayashi's Unity-Cipher](https://github.com/TakuKobayashi/UnityCipher/) to add the encrypt functionality to Asset Bundles through Asset Bundle.

Using this modified version on Asset Bundle Browser, users can add a ciphering secret keyword to their bundles to add an extra protection layer to their bundlings. Just go to Build Tab and check "Protect Bundle?" option. Then introduce the password. An extra folder named "Ciphered" will be created in your build's path containing the protected bundle files.
